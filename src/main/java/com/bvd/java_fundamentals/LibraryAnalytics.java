/*
 * The scenario is a library system managing book loans.
 * The focus is collections, streams, String handling, OO basics, and edge cases.

 * The CSV library data has to be loaded from a give file.
 * Each element (considered to be a line in CSV) has the following format:
        loanId,memberId,loanDate,bookTitle,genre,author,daysLoaned
            - loanDate is ISO date yyyy-MM-dd
            - daysLoaned is an integer

 * Tasks:
    - Implement BookLoan class (decide list of fields and methods based on the tasks requirements)
    - Implement logic to load the CSV data from a file located in the resources folder
    - Implement business logic for the methods from LibraryUtil utility class
        * loadResourceFile: loads the CSV file from resources folder
        * parseCsvLines: parse the loaded CSV file into a map of string and list of BookLoan objects, the keys should be "valid" and "malformed"
        * loansByGenre: count loans per genre, sorted alphabetically by genre.
        * topAuthorsByLoans: get top "n" authors by number of loans.
        * membersWithGenreDiversity: get members who borrowed books from at least "k" genres.
        * findFirstBookContaining: find the first book title containing a substring (case-insensitive).
        * isBookPresent: checks if the book is present in the loans (case-insensitive).
     - Extra mile:
        * Load the json file instead of CSV, serialize into BookLoan object and adapt the parsing logic accordingly using ObjectMapper from Jackson library.
        * Write unit tests in LibraryUtilTest for utility methods to ensure all edge cases are covered.
